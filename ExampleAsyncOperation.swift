/*Apple documentation encourages the usage of non-asynchronous operations in combination with an NSOperationQueue. 
 This way is simpler than the asynchronous one since you donâ€™t need to do the dirty work yourself. 
 A possible problem that can arise is that if you override the main method and you start an async task within it, 
 that task will not be completed. As soon the main method reaches the end, the operation is removed from its queue.
 So, for example, if you want to take advantage of NSURLSession API within an operation, 
 you need to rely on an asynchronous operation.*/
